# MongoDB 3.2 Notebooks and Testing Scripts

[MongoDB 3.2][3.2] comes with a set of new features for both developer and operation environments.
On this folder one can find several different examples of such features and how one can test and exploit certain functionality.

The developer component is mostly covered on [mongodb3.2.ipynb](../mongodb3.2.ipynb) where we use ipython notebooks to exemplify a few code samples that illustrate the most relevant new features and enhancements.

For the operations component we will approach it over this file with pointers to other scripts and auxiliary material available on this folder.

- Raftlike replication
- Encryption Storage Engine
